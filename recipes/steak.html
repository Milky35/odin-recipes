    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Take the tenderloins out of the fridge, and let them sit at room temperature for up to 45 minutes.
         Pat them dry with a clean paper towel. Sprinkle the steaks with steak seasoning.
         In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium heat.
          Add the steaks and cook until the meat reaches the desired doneness, about four to five minutes on each side.
           Remove the steaks from the pan.</p>
    <p>Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet. Cook and stir them over medium-high heat until tender.
        Add the beef broth, stirring to loosen the browned bits from the pan. Stir in the cream, steak sauce and garlic salt. Then bring it to a boil. 
        Cook and stir until the sauce is slightly thickened, about one to two minutes. Adjust the seasoning as needed.
        Return the steaks to the pan and turn them to coat with the sauce. Heat them through and stir in the chives.
