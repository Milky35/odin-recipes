    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water.
        Let it stand for five minutes to let the yeast foam up and activate. 
        Add the oil and salt. Stir in the flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.</p>
        <p>Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic, two to three minutes.
             Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top of the dough.
              Cover the bowl, and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
              Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Punch down the dough, and divide it in half. Press each half into a greased 12-inch pizza pan.
              In a bowl, stir together the tomato sauce, oregano and basil. Spread the sauce over each crust.
               If desired, add toppings of your choice. Sprinkle with cheese.
               Bake until the crust is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
